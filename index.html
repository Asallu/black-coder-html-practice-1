    <img src="img/Tequila.jpg" alt="shot glasses and lime" width="500" height="400">
    <p>Tequila is a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila 65 km northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco</p>
    <h2>Fun Tequila Facts</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Tequila is closer to lilies than cactus</strong> many believe Tequila is made from cactus, but the Agave plant is actually in the lily family not cactus.</li>
        <li><strong>Much of the work in making Tequila is done by hand</strong>
            Agave is hand selected for harvest and harvested by hand. In premium Tequilas, the pulp is extracted from the fiber in large stone bowls by humans after being ground down in the tahona.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tequila is basically a health food</strong> In addition to adding probiotics, a post-meal shot of tequila may help stimulate digestion. Some studies have also found that a shot of tequila before the meal acts as an apéritif, stimulating metabolism and appetite. 
        </li>
